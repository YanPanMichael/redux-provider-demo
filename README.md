For beginners like me to learn the concepts in Redux

To run this example:

Download this repo or git clone https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example.git
From the repo folder run:
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8000/ in the browser
And also head over to http://redux.js.org/ for some great documentation.

There is also a webpack and an ES5 example.
